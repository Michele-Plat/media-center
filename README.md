This project is a media-center script for the Rasperri Pi. The aim is to automatically integrate a USB stick with images/videos on it and to automatically play the media on it in loop. 
The USB sticks do not have to be named in a special way, because the program finds out this name automatically and saves it. 
The media on the USB stick can be played in a desired order. To do this, they must be named accordingly. (1st file name, 2nd file name or aa. file name etc.)
